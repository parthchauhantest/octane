## TABLE TRIMMING OPTIONS
# Several database tables containing Nagios event data can become quite large
# over time.  Most admins will want to trim these tables and keep only a
# certain amount of data in them.  The options below are used to specify the
# age (in MINUTES) that data should be allowd to remain in various tables
# before it is deleted.  Using a value of zero (0) for any value means that
# that particular table should NOT be automatically trimmed.

# Keep timed events for 24 hours
max_timedevents_age=1440

# Keep system commands for 1 week
max_systemcommands_age=10080

# Keep service checks for 1 week

# DEBUG LEVEL
# This option determines how much (if any) debugging information will
# be written to the debug file.  OR values together to log multiple
# types of information.
# Values: -1 = Everything
#          0 = Nothing
#          1 = Process info
#	   2 = SQL queries

debug_level=0



# DEBUG VERBOSITY
# This option determines how verbose the debug log out will be.
# Values: 0 = Brief output
#         1 = More detailed
#         2 = Very detailed

debug_verbosity=1



# DEBUG FILE
# This option determines where the daemon should write debugging information.

debug_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/ndo2db.debug



# MAX DEBUG FILE SIZE
# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the debug file.  If
# the file grows larger than this size, it will be renamed with a .old
# extension.  If a file already exists with a .old extension it will
# automatically be deleted.  This helps ensure your disk space usage doesn't
# get out of control when debugging.

max_debug_file_size=1000000
