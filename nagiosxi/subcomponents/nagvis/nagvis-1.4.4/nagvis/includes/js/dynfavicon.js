// BACKGROUND
// The main point of this script is to give you a means of alerting the user
// something has happened while your application is in a background tab. Serves
// a similar task to notifications in the operating system taskbar. A secondary
// function is to support favicon animation.
//
// This script works by DOM manipulation. After a call, there will be exactly one
// "rel='icon'" link and one "rel='shortcut icon'" link under the head element.
// Both of these are required for portability reasons. It would be nice  (from
// a performance perspective) if we could just update an existing link, if it
// already exists, but it turns out we can't. Firefox (and others?) will ignore
// changes to the link's attributes; it's only interested in a new link being
// added. So we have to delete and re-add in all cases.
