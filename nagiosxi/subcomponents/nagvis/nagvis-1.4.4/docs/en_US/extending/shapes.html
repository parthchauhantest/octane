		<h1>Add own Shapes</h1>
		
		<p>Since NagVis 1.x you can add &quot;stateless Icons&quot; to your maps, we call them shapes. These icons are completely like the other icons, they just have no state.</p>
		<h2>What is a shape?</h2>
		<p>A shape is nothing else than a simple image. We recommend to use PNG as format for the shapes.</p>
		<h2>Which programme should I use to create a shape?</h2>
		<p>Almost every graphic art software has the ability to build PNG-files.</p>
		<h2>Implementing the shape</h2>
		<p>The shapes are placed in <code>nagvis/images/shapes</code>. Just copy them to this directory, then you can use them in your maps.</p>
		<h2>The test</h2>
		<p>Open one of your maps and add a new shape-icon. You should now be able to select your own shapes.</p>
