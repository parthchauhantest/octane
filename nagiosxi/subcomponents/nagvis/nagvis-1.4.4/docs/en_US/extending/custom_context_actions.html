		<h1>Custom Context Menu Actions</h1>
		
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><img src="../../general/img/nagvis-1.4-context-ssh-1.png" style="margin-right:10px;" align="left" /> 
		NagVis 1.4 introduces a powerful new feature called context menus. The 
		context menus basically are right-click menus on the status icons. You can 
		customize these menus by simply editing some template files. The template
		files are simple html files including some macros which are replaced during
		render time in NagVis.</p>
		<p>The context menus give you the ability to improve your administrative
		workflow with the monitoring information dramatically. Imagine you have a 
		NagVis map as the primary user interface to gather status information about 
		your systems and even as a base to control your systems. Imagine you can view
		status information from NagVis and simply connect to the problematic systems
		by ssh or via terminal session by just two clicks. It is also possible to store
		some default recover jobs in scripts or anything else.</p>
		<p>Take a look at this guide to get some ideas of the power of this new feature.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Quick how-to</h2>
		<p>This is a quick how-to to add a &quot;connect by ssh&quot; option to the 
		NagVis hosts context menu. Most of the changes have to be made on the client
		browsers to get it handle ssh connections. In this guide I am using the firefox
		on Ubuntu. It is no problem to get this work on other systems like Windows.</p>
		
		<h3>1. Read basics about context templates</h3>
		
		The basics about the context templates are described <a href="../context_templates.html">here</a>. Read it before proceeding.
		
		<h3>2. Create custom context template</h3>
		
		Just copy the default backend:
		
		<pre>cd /usr/local/nagios/share/nagvis
cp nagvis/templates/context/tmpl.default.html nagvis/templates/context/tmpl.default-ssh.html</pre>
		
		Now add a line to the host specific macro section like follows
		
		<pre>&lt;li>&lt;a href="ssh://[address]">[lang_connect_by_ssh]&lt;/a>&lt;/li></pre>
		
		The template is finished.
		
		<h3>3. Configure host to use the new template</h3>
		
		Set the option to use the new template called default-ssh:
		
		<pre>context_menu=true
context_template=default-ssh</pre>
		
		You can set this option in the global section of a map, in a host object or even
		a template which is used in a host object.
		
		<h3>4. Configure your client to handle ssh:// uris</h3>
		
		In this case I configure firefox on Ubuntu Linux. This may differ on your system.
		
		Open <code>about:config</code> in your firefox. Add some new options:
		
		<pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.app.ssh
Type: String
Value: /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</pre>
		
		<pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.expose.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: true</pre>
		
		<pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.external.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: true</pre>
		
		<pre>Name: network.protocol-handler.warn-external.ssh
Type: Boolean
Value: false</pre>
		
		<h3>5. Create a handler script</h3>
		
		Create the script at the given script path. In my case it is <code>/usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</code>.
		
		<pre>#!/bin/bash
xterm -e ssh ${1#ssh:\/\/*}</pre>
		
		You need to make this script executable.
		
		<pre>chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ssh-connect-handler</pre>
		
		<h3>6. Test handler script</h3>
		
		Just enter <code>ssh://&lt;test-host></code> in your browser address bar and press enter.
		If an xterm with the ssh session opens everything is ok here.
		
		<h3>7. Test context links</h3>
		Now open the map you configured the new context template usage. Then 
		right-click the host you configured and hit the menu entry &quot;Connect by ssh&quot;.
		A terminal window should open now.
		
		<h2>Perspective</h2>
		<p>With this knowledge you are ready to configure NagVis to be the core of your
		daily administrative and monitoring tasks. Be creative now!</p>
		<p>We like you to give us some feedback on this feature and how you use it.</p>
