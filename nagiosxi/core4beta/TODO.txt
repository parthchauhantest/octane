TODO Prep for Core 4
=========
-   External Commands in Monitoring Engine Process dashlet uses last_command_check which is deprecated. 
    I believe we can just remove that from the dashlet now -SW

-   failure_prediction_enabled should be taken out of all host/service and templace configs (and in CCM/DB)

-   Verify livestatus works with Core 4 (add warning to upgrade if livestatus is detected in nagios.cfg)
-   Issues found with previously installed mod_gearman (nagios daemon will not load)
