[HIGH]
- Service escalation (and others??) lists duplicate contact groups
- Bulk disabled failure doesn't return an error message


[UNCONFIRMED OR CAN'T REPRODUCE]
- Notice: Undefined offset: 0 in /usr/local/nagiosxi/html/includes/components/ccm/classes/Form_class.php on line 586 -Services edit page
- CSS bugs on table topper on different platforms (clear button ,etc)
- Service escalations page has the Clear button in a weird place on Debian- Firefox 11
	- Probably a result of the absolute positioning of that div.  Improper use of box model...
