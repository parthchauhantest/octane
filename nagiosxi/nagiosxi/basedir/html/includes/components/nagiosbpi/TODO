ToDo List for NagiosBPI

[BUGS]
- Set controlled widths for all TD tags for more reliable formatting?

[PREP]


FUTURE VERSIONS:

- Current use of constants/$bpi_options is dumb.  Needs to be reworked for less redundancy, and none of these should be constants
- Need to be able to point to parent groups during child creation
	- This will require a new config specification
